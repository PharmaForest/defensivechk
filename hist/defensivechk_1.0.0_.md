# The `defensivechk` package, version: `1.0.0`;
  
---
 
This repository contains a SAS macro designed to perform defensive checks on macro parameters, datasets, and variables. It ensures that the necessary items are defined before further data processing, and if any required items are missing or incorrect, it will provide error messages and can abort execution.

## `%defensivechk()` macro <a name="defensivechk-macro-1"></a> ######

@file defensivechk.sas

@brief Validates required macro parameters, dataset existence, and variable presence in a defensive programming approach.

@details 
This macro performs runtime validation of required macro parameters, checks for the existence of a specified dataset, and verifies whether essential variables are present in that dataset. If any required elements are missing, it logs descriptive error messages and forcefully aborts execution. This promotes robustness and avoids silent failures.

Syntax:
@code
%defensivechk(
    reqparmlst=ds invar outvar,
    reqvardsn=work.input_data,
    reqvarlst=USUBJID PARAMCD AVAL
);
@endcode

Usage:
@code
%let ds = work.adsl;
%let invar = TRT01P;
%let outvar = RESULT;

%defensivechk(
    reqparmlst=ds invar outvar,
    reqvardsn=&ds,
    reqvarlst=USUBJID &invar
);
@endcode

@param reqparmlst Space-separated list of macro parameter names to validate as non-empty (e.g., ds invar outvar).
@param reqvardsn Name of the input dataset to check for existence.
@param reqvarlst Space-separated list of variable names expected to exist in the dataset specified in `reqvardsn`.

@return Aborts macro execution if any required parameter, dataset, or variable is missing. Otherwise, the macro completes silently.

@version 1.0

## `%varexist()` macro <a name="varexist-macro-2"></a> ######

The defensivechk macro uses the varexist macro, which is sourced from the SAS Community. This macro checks whether a specified variable exists in a dataset, and it returns 1 if the variable exists, and 0 if it does not.
